This repository is for a workshop at TISQA 2014, March 12 in Chapel Hill, NC.

## Systems Under Test ##
Using ccoenraets wine cellar php and node applications for this example.

Old app:

New app:

## Abstract ##
Your company’s execs have decided to re-write their old web application using new technologies.  They want to be able to say their platform is “api based” and “uses no-sql” while sipping martinis at the country club with the other suits.  After all, the most buzz words wins, right?

Now you’ve got to make sure all the functionality in the old app works in the new one, but how?

We’ve all seen automated testing from a black-box perspective.  Many of us have heard about integration tests but have no idea what they are or how to create them.

Join Paul Merrill of Beaufort Fairmont for this demystification of “integration testing”.

In this workshop we’ll write integration tests using RobotFramework to ensure the functionality of a traditional web app with legacy relational database based still exists in a new world, no sql, api based application.

Get exposure to RobotFramework, Mongo, and NodeJS and learn techniques for integration testing that will help you in your career right away!




## Organization ##

./tests is organized into sections.  Each subsequent section is a step forward in the history of how to create the test suites for the old application (01-04) and the new one (05-?).

See the LogOfChanges.txt for more information on each section and what I was attempting to show with each section.
