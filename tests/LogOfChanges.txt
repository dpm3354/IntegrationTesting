01
=======

* Initial setup and creation of simple tests.


02
=======

* Moved variables to variables file as test suite grows… 
  * IP changed for host, and had to change in 3 places.
  * Added Database variables


03
=======

* Made DatabaseTest.txt data driven


04
=======

* Cross-check
What if there is a mistake in your tests?  Hard-coded expectations should be checked.


05
=======
* MAKE SURE MONGO is STARTED: mongod
* move to other API
* made dirs for both test suites
* created API-2.txt
* changed url and port and path.
* note tests fail… why?  Because the json from the api is different.  no 'wine' section
* wget on old api, wget on new api  in files wines.json.old wines.json.new
* make note of the issue or bug it and move on.


06
=======
* Updated the tests to not look for the wines array, just assume you get the wines array back (which we do).
* notice there are 24 wines now!!!  (something went wrong in migration?)


07
=======
* we know the api is different.  What about the data?
* https://github.com/iPlantCollaborativeOpenSource/Robotframework-MongoDB-Library
* pip install pymongo
* sudo python setup.py install
* (Manhandled) Added mongodblibrary to /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages (?)
